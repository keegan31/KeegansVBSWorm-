## 🛠️ What It Does

This faux worm performs the following harmless tasks:

- 🔁 Adds itself to Windows startup (HKCU).
- 🧃 Copies itself to connected USB drives.
- 🐭 Slightly moves the mouse cursor randomly.
- ⚠️ Displays annoying fake warning messages in English.
- 🧠 Randomly renames a few files on Desktop and Downloads folder (limited to `.png`, `.jpg`, `.txt`, `.vbs`, `.exe`).
